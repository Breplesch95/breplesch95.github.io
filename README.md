# How to make a header.

To properly make a header, you add a '#' in front of the word you want to use. If you want a differeng size for your header, you can add another hashtag in front.
**example:** 
# HELLO = #HELLO
## HELLO = # # HELLO
### HELLO = # # # HELLO

# How to make paragraphs.
To properly write paragraphs in markdown, you must use a blank line to seperate one or more lines of writing. You must also stay left aligned, which means you must not use tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.
**example:**

Hello, this is a sentence.

Now I am writing another sentence.

# How to add emphasis

How you can add emphasis to your words is by using 2 asterisks before and after to bold a word. You can also bold a word in the middle of a sentence by adding 2 asterisks on both sides of the word or phrase you want to bold, WITHOUT spacing them.

**Example:** **HELLO** = * * HELLO * * _ _ HELLO _ _ (without spaces.)

Another way is to italicize your words, to do this is by adding either an asterisks or underscore before and after the word or phrase.

**Example:** *HELLO* = * HELLO * (Without spaces.)

A final way to add emphasis is to add **_both_** asterisks and underscores before and after a word or phrase.

**EXAMPLE:**

**_HELLO_** = * * _ HELLO _ * * (Withought spaces.)
