<p>Hello, I'm Breanna Plescher!
</p> <p>I'm from Millington, TN, I'm 27, go by she/her, and I'm here to broaden my horizons and learn how to code.</p> 
<p>I can't wait to get started learning with you guys!</p>

<p>__Growth Mindset__ is the belief that a person can develop and improve, with hard work and perserverance. </p>

<p>I'll keep myself in a growth mindset by admitting when I need help, putting in genuine effort, 
and rolling with the punches.</p>
